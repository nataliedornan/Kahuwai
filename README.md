UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science and Management GP Project: Kahuwai

These codes will take you through the data process involved with prepping data for use in the EPA Stormwater Management Model, 5.1, and visualizing the output data. The data are organized in files, which should be run in order. The first three folders involve code for input into SWMM, the last two files provide code for output data visualizations used in our final deliverables.
