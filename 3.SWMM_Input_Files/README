SWMM_Input_Files

Author: Erica Johnson, 06/04/2020

Use the .rmd files after exporting the necessary attribute tables of the stormwater system and subcatchment delineation and characterization of your watershed. 

The sw_network_allpoints_wailupe.csv and sw_network_endpoints_wailupe.csv files are the attribute table files necessary to run the stormwater_network_wailupe_final.Rmd in the folder.

Our suggestion is to run  the stormwater_network_wailupe_final.Rmd file first. This will provide you with the subc_outlet.csv file that, in addition to the subc_attributes.csv and subc_points.csv, will be used for the  subcatchments_wailupe_final.Rmd.

The code will provide several separate files labelled starting with "inp". These are parts of the SWMM input file that will need to be put together.

The "inp_wailupe_raw.xlsx" file is what the input file should look like after 1. making a project in SWMM and opening its input file, 2. incorporating the separate "inp" labelled files into a SWMM input file.
